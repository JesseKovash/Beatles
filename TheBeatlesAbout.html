      <p><span><strong>The Beatles </strong></span>were an English rock band, 
         formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, 
         George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential 
         act of the rock era. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity 
         first emerged as "Beatlemania", which is a term that describe the 
         intense fan frenzy directed toward the British band. The phenomenon 
         began in 1963 and continued past the band's breakup in 1970.

      <p>The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and 
          Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe 
          initially serving as bass player. The core of Lennon, McCartney and 
          Harrison went through a succession of drummers, most notably Pete Best, 
          before asking Starr to join them. They gained popularity in the United 
          Kingdom after their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. They acquired 
          the nickname "the Fab Four" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the 
          following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, 
          leading the "British Invasion" of the United States pop market. From 
          1965 onwards, the Beatles produced what many consider their finest 
          material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber 
          Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band 
          (1967), The Beatles (commonly known as the White Album, 1968) and Abbey 
          Road (1969).

          After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers 
          of varying lengths. McCartney and Starr, the surviving members, remain 
          musically active. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison 
          died of lung cancer in November 2001.</p>
